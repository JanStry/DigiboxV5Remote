Proximus Digibox IR codes ready for TasmotaIR
probably also working for ESPHome (untested) pleas let me know if it works.

the IR codes can't be decoded by a normal IR receiver and i could not find any usefull codes online, so decided to use a logic analyser and capture the RAW IR codes myself.
use at your own risk.
